Readme:

The game is set in Scriptopia,
the basic idea is similar to the old TS client MUDs, on green screen text like Fallout pipboy or Apple IIe

The user navigates through the 'dungeon' and picks up items that can be used to increase attack power and heal
Originally planned to have more features like they need to have the torch or they would die tripping on a snail
and the buisness card would be needed to enlist aid from the defendor, while the magic scroll could be used as
an legal objection to the trail and give a win condition.

scaled back features to get this working properly, but could use some future improvements and add in more features.

The basic commands are stored in an array so can add different variations.

I added in a video of a play through, unfortunately the audio didn't get recorded.

Thanks for take a look at my game.
